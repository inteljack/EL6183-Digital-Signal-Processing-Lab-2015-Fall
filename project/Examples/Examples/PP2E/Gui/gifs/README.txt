This directory contains image files used by various
examples in the book (e.g., canvaspics, movingpics).
You can extend or replace this set of files without
breaking any examples.

As of 7/00 (Tk 8.0, Python 1.5.2), the standard Tk 
photo image supports GIF, PPM, and PGM files.  There
is a C patch which adds JPEG as well.  XBM bitmap 
files are supported by the bitmap image object.
Also see the PIL image processing library at 
www.python.org, and in chapters 6 and 7.

**PLEASE NOTE** 
This directory originally included lots of other images
(Monty Python, a certain Hormel product, and more), but
was trimmed at the last minute because we did not get 
permission to use these photos on CD (we also had to cut
screen shots in the book itself).  Alas, big companies 
apparently have no sense of humor :-).  To make image 
examples more interesting, drop some GIF files of your
own in this directory.
