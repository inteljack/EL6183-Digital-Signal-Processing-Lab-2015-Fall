# Sidebar: Is PyToe artificially intelligent?  (end of chapter)
# Well, maybe, but it depends on what you call intelligent.
# PyToe is smart enough to notice imminent wins and losses,
# and to reasonably select from a set of alternative moves.
# When a win or loss isn't imminent, it uses a scoring scheme,
# sometimes called a _heuristic_, to rank the "goodness" of 
# alternative moves.
# 
# But PyToe's view is limited to the next move; it's unable to
# look ahead through a series of moves and countermoves to
# analyse the consequences of a given move.  Especially for
# more complex two-player games such as chess, it's more 
# traditional to search through all possible moves and 
# countermoves, and pick moves that maximize the chances of
# reaching a win, and minimize moves that can lead to a loss.
# In fact, there's a name for this technique: _minimax_ search.
# (VERIFY NAME)
# 
# Minimax game search is described fully in most AI texts.  But 
# roughly, such a search generates new boards ("states") for each
# possible move, with the candidate move made.  For each new board,
# it then generates boards with all possible countermoves, and so 
# on, generating all possible moves at each level, and detecting
# wins and loses along the way.  Such a search lets the program 
# look ahead in the game to be more informed about the consequences
# of its actions.  In practice, the search may stop after so many
# levels of lookahead, and apply a heuristic to score the resulting
# board state; especially for complex games or large boards, it's 
# not practical to explore all possible moves and countermoves 
# to end game states (you'd run out of time and memory).  PyToe
# picks moves with some intelligence, but has no notion of lookahead;
# that may be okay for this simple game, but may hurt in others.
# 
# But can PyToe be called an "expert system"--a system that encodes 
# and applies expert-level knowledge?  Again, maybe.  In some sense, 
# its move selection logic can be viewed as domain knowledge, encoded 
# in the Python language.  In fact, selects moves more or less the 
# way I would (though I usually look ahead to possible countermoves
# too).  General expert systems, though, usually encode domain 
# knowledge rules in a more symbolic form, and apply it using
# more general-purpose algorithms called "inference engines".
# We'll see such a system in the last chapter in this part of
# the book--the PyExpert expert system shell.
# 
# All of which doesn't quite answer the question this sidebar
# raises.  If pressed, I'd say you could call PyToe intelligent 
# if you can't tell it's a machine, and if it's smart enough 
# to beat you on a regular basis.  For me, that's a positive.

# In fact, there's a name for this technique: _minimax_ search.
# (VERIFY NAME)
# 
# Minimax game search is described fully in most AI texts.  But 
# roughly, such a search generates new boards ("states") for each
# possible move, with the candidate move made.  For each new board,
# it then generates boards with all possible countermoves, and so 
# on, generating all possible moves at each level, and detecting
# wins and loses along the way.  Such a search lets the program 
# look ahead in the game to be more informed about the consequences
# of its actions.  In practice, the search may stop after so many
# levels of lookahead, and apply a heuristic to score the resulting
# board state; especially for complex games or large boards, it's 
# not practical to explore all possible moves and countermoves 
# to end game states (you'd run out of time and memory).  PyToe
# picks moves with some intelligence, but has no notion of lookahead;
# that may be okay for this simple game, but may hurt in others.
# (Acutally, the 'nasty' mode's scoring system accounts for wins
# and losses 2 moves away; but to look further ahead, we'd need
# to kepp adding hard-coded rules, and this is less than a general
# algorithm solution).
# 
# But can PyToe be called an "expert system"--a system that encodes 
# and applies expert-level knowledge?  Again, maybe.  In some sense, 
# its move selection logic can be viewed as domain knowledge, encoded 
# in the Python language.  In fact, selects moves more or less the 
# way I would (though I usually look ahead to possible countermoves
# too).  General expert systems, though, usually encode domain 
# knowledge rules in a more symbolic form, and apply it using
# more general-purpose algorithms called "inference engines".
# We'll see such a system in the last chapter in this part of
# the book--the PyExpert expert system shell.

# Intro: Of course, you can get a lot of work done without
# Canvases too.  In fact, the ideas of packing frames and
# using grids are often suffiecient for contructing complex
# GUI layouts.  Our next example demonstrate this idea: it
# uses a simple grid of labels to build a game board.
# Tic-tac-toe, naughts-and-crosses, N-across
# by default, 3-across=ttt, but can vary Degree to change 
# board size (the number of row and column)
#
# - this is an application of grids, but too complex
#   to show where grids introduced--new case study at end
#   of gui chapter (?)
# - probs: pack mixed with grid if GuiMaker is used 
# - squares = {}   # or append cell to row, row to cols
# - cells and board share same State objects--changes to 
#   one auto noticed by other ref--ex of where shared objs
#   are a Good Thing  (could use lists instead of State attrs);

# if you find yourself adding comments before a big block of

# explain wait_variable(var): puases caller until the 
# variable (a Tkinter variable, not plain Python var) has

# vars are global in scope, but Tkinter auto generates 
# and uses unique Tk var names behind the scenes--treat

# coding alt: 
# Notice how the smart mode's move selection logic detects 
# imminent wins and losses: it mark a candidate move on 
# the board, rune the end-game win detector, and then unmarks
# the candidate move.  It plays a sort of 'what if' experiment.
# I originally coded smart mode's isWin/isLoss tests
# to use the count arrays rather than the end-game win check, 
# because I thought it would be faster (hashing versus multiple
# table scans).  As it turned out, pickMove was fast enough to 
# appear instantaneous, so I used the end-game chack instead.
# In fact, move selection is so fast, that I decide to add a 
# 2-secnd delay (time.sleep(2)), to make it easier for the user
# to notice which move hte machine picked.  (Years of using 
# slower AI languages have made me paranoid).
