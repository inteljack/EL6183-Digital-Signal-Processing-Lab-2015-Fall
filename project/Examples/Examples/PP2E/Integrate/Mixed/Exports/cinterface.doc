/**********************************************************
 * Export C names for use in Python programs.  Defines
 * a C extension type which maps C variables to Python 
 * object attributes ('object.attr'), so they can be 
 * fetched and assigned in Python programs.  Python code 
 * uses attributes of an instance of the exported Cvar 
 * extension type to access exported C names.  Define
 * a name->address mapping table or function externally.
 *
 * This is a general, reusable interface: all C names 
 * to be exported to Python programs, as well as the C 
 * name->address mapping table or function, are defined 
 * externally and linked in (to the enclosing C program,
 * or to cinterface.so as other .o/.so files); both the 
 * exported names and the name->address mapping logic 
 * may vary per program that employs the cinterface.so 
 * type interface.  This interface can be used in 2 modes:
 * 
 * 1) Provide your own CnameMapTable:  
 *    Compile the defaultlookup.c table lookup function, 
 *    link it into the process (either with the enclosing C
 *    program, or with cinterface.so), and define C name
 *    'CnameMapTable' to be a pointer to a name->address
 *    mapping table. 
 *
 * 2) Provide your own CnameMapLookup:
 *    If your program can't provide a pointer to a table of
 *    name->address mappings, define your own 'CnameMapLookup'
 *    function, and link it to the enclosing C program, or
 *    cinterface.so.  This allows for more dynamic mapping,
 *    and doesn't require 'CnameMapTable' to be defined.
 * 
 * See cinterface.h for type details.  In general:
 * - cinterface.so always expects CnameMapLookup to be defined 
 *   externally and linked in, either statically or dynamically.
 *
 * - if used, the default CnameMapLookup in defaultlookup.c 
 *   expects name CnameMapTable to be defined and linked in.
 *
 * cinterface.so is a dynamically-loaded module, linked with your
 * process when first imported (by a Python script or C lib call).
 * The external names CnameMapLookup or CnameMapTable can either 
 * come from either the enclosing C program (in which case they  
 * will be linked with cinterface.so when it's imported), or be 
 * linked to cinterface.so in your makefile (as a .o or .so).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If you provide your own CnameMapLookup, it can map 
 *   names to type/address dynamically and arbitrarily;
 *   it should return a cnameMap*, or NULL for bad names.
 * - The CnameMapTable name->address mapping table used by the 
 *   default defaultlookup.c can also hold any C items with an 
 *   address (not just global C variables) 
 * - If used, only items listed in a CnameMapTable are visible 
 *   to Python code--header files are never inspected
 * - If used, CnameMapTable is really a pointer to a table: 
 *   if you need to add names dynamically, expand your program's
 *   table as needed (e.g., realloc, or free+malloc new), and 
 *   set CnameMapTable to the result table;
 * - Also expects a CnameMessage char array to be defined
 *   in the C program--a simple exported global text area
 * - The Cvar extension type is accessed by an exported 
 *   module constructor function; it overloads qualifications
 *   to allow C variables to be visible as simple attributes
 * - For the first book example, a CnameMapTable is defined by
 *   an enclosing C layer, which runs embedded Python code, 
 *   which uses the exported names interface; cinterface.so
 *   can be used in other scenarios, as long as you link in 
 *   a CnameMapTable somehow (e.g., via a makefile step)
 * - Like all C extensions, cinterface could also be linked 
 *   statically, rather than compiling to a dynamic .so file;
 *   for testing, we compile it with and without lookup code;
 * - The main reason for using a C type here is to intercept
 *   attribute qualifications in Python code ('object.attr'),
 *   and route them to the enclosing C layer; classes can 
 *   catch qualifications too, and the dir ClassAndMod here 
 *   shows how to reimplement cinterface as a Python code
 *   class and simple C module, albeit at some speed loss.
 *
 * Also see Integrate/Extend/Swig--SWIG can produce a similar 
 * name interface automatically, but:
 * - SWIG  only exports C global variables: the table used 
 *   by the default lookup here can hold arbitrary C addresses
 * - the type defined here can be reused in any program that 
 *   exports C names: simply define a CnameMapTable for your 
 *   names (or a CnameMapLookup function), import module 
 *   cinterface from Python scripts or C, and make a Cvar()
 * - if you provide your own CnameMapLookup, you can perform
 *   arbitrary name->address mapping at run time.
 *
 * Caveats: 
 * - For the default table-based lookup scheme, we 
 *   could instead pass a mapping table to the Cvar() 
 *   constructor to allow more than one name set per program, 
 *   but that may require extra protocol to export mapping 
 *   tables to Python (where Cvar's may be created).  
 * - In fact, this C type could be more widely reusable 
 *   if we could store both a C object pointer and lookup 
 *   function pointer in Cvar() instances; that way, we might 
 *   use it to handle arbitrary, nested C/C++ object name 
 *   qualifications (e.g., for  'a.b.c.d', we would make a 
 *   new Cvar() at each '.' with a pointer to the derived
 *   C/C++ object plus a custom lookup routine for that 
 *   object); as is, this type only allows for 1-level 
 *   lookups and simple type conversions, but that's as
 *   much complexity as this example warrants.  Generalizing
 *   it to handle nested objects is left as an exercise.
