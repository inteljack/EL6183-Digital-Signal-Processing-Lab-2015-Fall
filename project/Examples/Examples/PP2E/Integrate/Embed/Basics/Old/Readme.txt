In the first edition, these examples all used the built-in
string module, rather than a user-coded module.  Their 
original versions are included here for reference.  It's 
okay to use built-in modules as namespaces for strings, set
attributes there, and run objects fetched from them (especially
utility functions they export), but it's probably more common 
to run embedded code from user-coded files.
