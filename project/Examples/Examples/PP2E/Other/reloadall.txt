You're clearly on the right path; the crux of the 
matter is type-testing everything in a module's
attribute dictionary.  But this is a difficult 
exercise, and is more subtle than it may appear.
A few pointers:

1) Note that the result of calling a __dict__.keys()
method is a list of string names, not actual objects;
that is, your type() tests will always fail because 
the thing you're testing is still a string, as returned
by keys().  The reload calls would fail too, since they
need a module object, not a string name.  

To go from the name back to the object, you need to either
index the __dict__ on the name:
   anon_obj = arg.__dict__[anon_obj]

or use a getattr call which is roughly equivalent: 
   getattr(arg, anon_obj)).  

If that doesn't make sense, try adding print statements
to trace the type() of variables in your code along the way.

2) Your solution won't reload a module passed in as a top
level argument, and will only reload 2 levels deep below
the argument.  To support arbitrarily deep import paths,
you need to use a recursive call.

3) There is a built-in library module in Python called
"types" which predefines names for all possible type()
return values; you can use that instead of importing to
get a module type constant.  See the reference manual
for more details.

4) You can also say "dir(module)" instead of 
"module.__dict__.keys()".  These are equivalent when sorted.

5) If you don't want to deal with the __dict__.keys()
string-to-object business, you could instead just say
module.__dict__.values() in the for loop header, to get 
a list of values (the actual objects) in the attribute
dictionary, instead of string keys.  This won't let you
do filtering by name easily, but you may not need to.

6) The most subtle thing is that you need to avoid 
recuring to reload a module if it's already been reloaded.
Otherwise, you can get stuck in an infinite loop when 
there are recursive imports between files (module A imports
module B which eventually imports A again -- your code may
wind up going back and forth forever).  The easiest way to
avoid cycles is to keep track of already-reloaded modules
in a dictionary (recall that keys can be immutable objects
like modules).  I didn't realize this myself until I tried
reloading some big system modules like os.  

7) There's also no point in reloading a module more than once 
if it can be reached more that once by following import paths,
even if there is no import cycle (e.g., A imports B and C, 
and B and C both import D); once a module is reloaded once,
you've got its new code everywhere it is used.  The dictionary
trick to trap cycles will avoid this case as well. 

Again, this is actually a fairly hard problem, even for a 
Python expert.  Here is how I'd code the solution with the 
changes above; this may or may not be optimal, but it may 
give you some ideas.  You may have to view this email in
