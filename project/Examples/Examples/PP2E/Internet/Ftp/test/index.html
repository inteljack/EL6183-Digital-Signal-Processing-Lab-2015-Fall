<P>A few notes:

<OL>
<LI>As of 2/2000, the new book examples pages listed above are beta
quality and experimental; the 2nd Edition of Programming Python (PP2E) 
won't be released until Spring or Summer 2000.  

<LI>I now keep a mirror copy of my home page here because my 
original ISP, Rocky Mountain Internet, became unreliable; if you 
are in a political mood, you can read more about that story 
<A HREF="home/rmimove.html">here</A>.  

<LI>My other coordinates and background are available in the training page 
listed above.  Information about other book's I've written is located in
my home page mirror.
