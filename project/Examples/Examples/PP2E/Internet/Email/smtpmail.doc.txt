# use the Python SMTP mail interface module to send
# email messages; this is just a simple one-shot 
# send script--see pymail.py for a client with more
# user interaction features, and popmail.py for a
# script which retrieves mail; smtp is used to 
# send mail, and runs on a socket using port 
# number 25 on the server machine, but Python's 
# smtplib hides all protocol details; to fetch 
# mail, use the poplib or imaplib modules instead;
# on some systems, you can also send email with: 
# os.popen('mail -s "xxx" a@b.c', 'w').write(text), 
# but smtp is more portable/powerful (see PyErrata);
# notes: could escape '\nFrom' in the body with '>'
# so as not to terminate the email, but this is
# probably superfluous here--servers do this too;
# smtplib raises an exception if nobody got the
# mail, else returns a dictionary containing any
# recipients that failed (empty if no errors);
