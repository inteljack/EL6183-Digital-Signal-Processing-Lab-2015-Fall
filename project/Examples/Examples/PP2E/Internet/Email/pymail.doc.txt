# use the Python POP3 mail interface module to view
# your pop email account messages; runs on top of 
# sockets (the mail server may be a remote machine),
# and uses the rfc822 module to extract mail header 
# information; this is a very simple command-line 
# browsing interface, but is a start at a scriptable
# replacement for things like MS-Outlook (I wrote
# this right after my ISP took away telnet access);
# also see the library manual for modules multifile
# and mimetools to handle multi-part messages and 
# decoding, and the imaplib module for IMAP4 servers; 
# uses StringIO to make msg text a file-like object;
# retrieving messages does not delete them--keeps a
# list of messages to delete and reconnects on exit;
# it would be easy to throw the index in a Tkinter
# ilstbox and display messages in a scrolled text 
# box, as a GUI mail interface--see PyMailGui.py.
