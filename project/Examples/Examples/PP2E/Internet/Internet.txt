Internet examples.  See the README files in the subdirectories
here for details on a particular group of examples.  

The script LaunchBrowser.py in the examples root directory 
attempts to spawn a browser on a given example page; it can
be used to bring up pages in the Cgi-Web directory, whether 
you have an Internet feed or not.   Cgi-Web/PyInternetDemos.html
has links to all the major browser-based examples.
