To start from scratch, you need to have the following
2 lock files in this directory:

    commentDB.lck  errataDB.lck

They can be simply empty text files, or contain any
arbitrary text (they're only used for mutex locks).
The system creates files commentDB, errataDB (shelves),
commentDB.log, and errataDB.log (lock message logs).
See ../dbswitch.py to enable shelve mode.
