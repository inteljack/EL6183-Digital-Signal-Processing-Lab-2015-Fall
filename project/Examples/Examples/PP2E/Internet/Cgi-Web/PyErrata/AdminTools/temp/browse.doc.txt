# on browse requests: fetch and display data in new page;
# report data is stored in dictionaries on the database;
# caveat: the '#Si' section links generated for top of page
# indexes work on a recent Internet Explorer, but have been 
# seen to fail on an older Netscape--section links in cgi
# generated files may be a non-standard html feature; if 
# they fail, try using 'index only' mode, which uses url 
# links to encode information for creating a new page;
# url links must be encoded with urllib, not cgi.escape 
# (which encodes text embedded in the html reply stream);
# for an older netscape, had to replace blanks with '+'
# in the generated url link in indexonly mode (the url 
# escape for a space, %20, works too)--Internet Explorer 
# automatically changes a space to %20 when the url is 
# invoked/clicked/submitted, so this replacement step isn't
# always needed; urllib.quote_plus does it automatically;
