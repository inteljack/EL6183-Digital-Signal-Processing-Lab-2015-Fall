 
# I am a module package  (for mutexcntl)

# Note that my parent dir (Errata) doesn't need a __init__.py,
# nor does Errata need to be on PYTHONPATH -- it's the home
# dir ('.') of the cgi script invoked on browse/submit requests,
# so module/package searches start there automatically; but 
# if mutexcntl is ever used elsewhere, this will need to change;
